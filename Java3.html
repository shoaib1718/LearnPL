                In this section, we are going to learn, what happens while we compile and run the Java program.
                Moreover, we will see some questions based on the first program.

            <div class="div1">
                At compile time, the Java file is compiled by Java Compiler (It does not interact with OS) and converts
                the Java code into bytecode.

                After writing the program, programmer needs to compile that program. As soon as the programmer starts
                compiling the program using javac compiler, the compile time gets started, and it ends when either a
                .class file is generated after successful compilation or an error is thrown in compilation. In other way
                we can say, the process of compiling a program is referred as compile time.

            <h2> <u>How to set path in Java </u> </h2>
            <div class="div1">
                The path is required to be set for using tools such as javac, java, etc.

                If you are saving the Java source file inside the JDK/bin directory, the path is not required to be set
                because all the tools will be available in the current directory.

                However, if you have your Java file outside the JDK/bin folder, it is necessary to set the path of JDK.

                There are two ways to set the path in Java:
                <ol>
                    <li>Temporary</li>
                    <li>Permanent</li>
                </ol>

            <h2><u>Difference between JDK, JRE, and JVM</u></h2>
            <div class="div1">
                We must understand the differences between JDK, JRE, and JVM before proceeding further to Java. See the
                brief overview of JVM here. <br>

                Firstly, let's
                see the differences between the JDK, JRE, and JVM.
                <br><br>
                <h3><u>JVM</u></h3>
                JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is an abstract machine. It is called a virtual machine because it doesn't
                physically exist. It is a specification that provides a runtime environment in which Java bytecode can
                be executed. It can also run those programs which are written in other languages and compiled to Java
                bytecode.

                JVMs are available for many hardware and software platforms. JVM, JRE, and JDK are platform dependent
                because the configuration of each OS is different from each other. However, Java is platform
                independent. There are three notions of the JVM: specification, implementation, and instance. <br>
                The JVM performs the following main tasks:
                <ul>
                    <li>Loads code</li>
                    <li>Verifies code</li>
                    <li>Executes code</li>
                    <li>Provides runtime environment</li>
                </ul>
                <br>

                <h3><u>JRE</u></h3>
                JRE is an acronym for Java Runtime Environment. It is also written as Java RTE. The Java Runtime
                Environment is a set of software tools which are used for developing Java applications. It is used to
                provide the runtime environment. It is the implementation of JVM. It physically exists. It contains a
                set of libraries + other files that JVM uses at runtime. <br> <br>

                <h3><u>JDK</u></h3>
                JDK is an acronym for Java Development Kit. The Java Development Kit (JDK) is a software development
                environment which is used to develop Java applications and applets. It physically exists. It contains
                JRE + development tools. <br>

                JDK is an implementation of any one of the below given Java Platforms released by Oracle Corporation:
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Standard Edition Java Platform</li>
                    <li>Enterprise Edition Java Platform</li>
                    <li>Micro Edition Java Platform</li>
                </ul>
                The JDK contains a private Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and a few other resources such as an
                interpreter/loader (java), a compiler (javac), an archiver (jar), a documentation generator (Javadoc),
                etc. to complete the development of a Java Application.
