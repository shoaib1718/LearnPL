            <h1><u>History of Java </u></h1>
            <div class="div1">
                The history of Java is very interesting. Java was originally designed for interactive television, but it
                was too advanced technology for the digital cable television industry at the time. The history of Java
                starts with the Green Team. Java team members (also known as Green Team), initiated this project to
                develop a language for digital devices such as set-top boxes, televisions, etc. However, it was best
                suited for internet programming. Later, Java technology was incorporated by Netscape.

                The principles for creating Java programming were "Simple, Robust, Portable, Platform-independent,
                Secured, High Performance, Multithreaded, Architecture Neutral, Object-Oriented, Interpreted, and
                Dynamic". Java was developed by James Gosling, who is known as the father of Java, in 1995. James
                Gosling and his team members started the project in the early '90s.
                <br>
                Currently, Java is used in internet programming, mobile devices, games, e-business solutions, etc.
                Following are given significant points that describe the history of Java.
                <br>

                1. James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton initiated the Java language project in June 1991.
                The small team of sun engineers called Green Team. <br>
                2. Initially it was designed for small, embedded systems in electronic appliances like set-top boxes.
                <br>

                3. Firstly, it was called "Greentalk" by James Gosling, and the file extension was .gt. <br>

                4. After that, it was called Oak and was developed as a part of the Green project. <br>
