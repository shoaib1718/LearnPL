                <h3><u> What is Java? </u></h3>
                Java is a high-level, general-purpose, object-oriented, and secure programming language developed by
                James Gosling at Sun Microsystems, Inc. in 1991. It is formally known as OAK. In 1995, Sun Microsystem
                changed the name to Java. In 2009, Sun Microsystem takeover by Oracle Corporation.

                <h2> <u> Editions of Java </u> </h2>
                Each edition of Java has different capabilities. <br>
                There are three editions of <br>
                Java Standard Editions (JSE): It is used to create programs for a desktop computer.
                Java Enterprise Edition (JEE): It is used to create large programs that run on the server and manages
                heavy traffic and complex transactions.
                Java Micro Edition (JME): It is used to develop applications for small devices such as set-top boxes,
                phone, and appliances. <br><br>
                <h3> <u> Types of Java Applications </u></h3>
                There are four types of Java applications that can be created using Java programming: <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Standalone Applications:</b> Java standalone applications uses GUI components such as AWT,
                        Swing,
                        and
                        JavaFX. These components contain buttons, list, menu, scroll panel, etc. It is also known as
                        desktop
                        alienations. <br><br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Enterprise Applications:</b> An application which is distributed in nature is called
                        enterprise
                        applications. <br><br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b> Web Applications:</b> An applications that run on the server is called web applications. We
                        use JSP, Servlet, Spring, and Hibernate technologies for creating web applications.<br><br>
                    </li>

                        </b> Java ME is a cross-platform to develop mobile applications which run
                        across smartphones. Java is a platform for App Development in Android.

                Java Platform is a collection of programs. It helps to develop and run a program written in the Java
                programming language. Java Platform includes an execution engine, a compiler and set of libraries. Java
                is a platform-independent language.

                        <b>
                            Simple: </b>Java is a simple language because its syntax is simple, clean, and easy to
                        understand. Complex and ambiguous concepts of C++ are either eliminated or re-implemented in
                        Java. For example, pointer and operator overloading are not used in Java.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <b>Object-Oriented:</b> In Java, everything is in the form of the object. It means it has some
                        data and behavior. A program must have at least one class and object.
                    </li> <br>
                    <li>
                        <b>Robust:</b> Java makes an effort to check error at run time and compile time. It uses a
                        strong memory management system called garbage collector. Exception handling and garbage
                        collection features
                        make it strong.

                            Secure:</b> Java is a secure programming language because it has no explicit pointer and
                        programs runs in the virtual machine. Java contains a security manager that defines the access
                        of Java classes.

                        This byte code is platform-independent and can be run on any machine.

                        features. Everything related to storage is predefined, for example, the size of primitive data
                        types. <br><br>

                        the use of the Just-In-Time compiler. <br><br>

                    <b>
                        Distributed:</b> Java also has networking facilities. It is designed for the distributed
                    environment of the internet because it supports TCP/IP protocol. It can run over the internet. EJB
                    and RMI are used to create a distributed system. <br><br>

                            OOPs (Object Oriented Programming System) </u>
                </b> </h2>
                Object-oriented programming is a way of solving a complex problem by breaking them into a small
                sub-problem. An object is a real-world entity. It is easier to develop a program by using an object. In
                OOPs, we create programs using class and object in a structured manner.
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b> Class:</b> A class is a template or blueprint or prototype that defines data members and
                        methods of an object. An object is the instance of the class. We can define a class by using the
                        class keyword.
                        <br><br>
                    </li>
                    <li>

                        <b>Object:</b> An object is a real-world entity that can be identified distinctly. For example,
                        a desk, a circle can be considered as objects. An object has a unique behavior, identity, and
                        state. Data fields with their current values represent the state of an object (also known as its
                        properties or attributes).
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <b>Abstraction:</b> An abstraction is a method of hiding irrelevant information from the user.
                        For example, the driver only knows how to drive a car; there is no need to know how does the car
                        run. We can make a class abstract by using the keyword abstract. In Java, we use abstract class
                        and interface to achieve abstraction.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <b>Encapsulation:</b> An encapsulation is the process of binding data and functions into a
                        single unit. A class is an example of encapsulation. In Java, Java bean is a fully encapsulated
                        class.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <b>Inheritance:</b> Inheritance is the mechanism in which one class acquire all the features of
                        another class. We can achieve inheritance by using the extends keyword. It facilitates the
                        reusability of the code.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <b>Polymorphism:</b> The polymorphism is the ability to appear in many forms. In other words,
                        single action in different ways. For example, a boy in the classroom behaves like a student, in
                        house behaves like a son. There are two types of polymorphism: run time polymorphism and
                        compile-time polymorphism.
